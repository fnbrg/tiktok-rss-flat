    <content>As a hopeful president of Singapore, I remain resolute in my commitment to serve the people of this great nation. Despite any challenges or obstacles that may arise, I am steadfast in my determination to stand up for the needs and interests of all Singaporeans. Whether through community outreach, or other means, I will work tirelessly to ensure that the voices of the people are heard and their concerns addressed.

    <content>I totally reject AWARE‚Äôs allegations and insinuations that social media posts I have made ‚Äúobjectify‚Äù women.  I do not objectify women since I have many in my family. I have been happily married to my loving wife for nearly 50 years.  We have been faithful to each other through the years and no tinge of infidelity or scandal has ever attached to my marriage.  I have two wonderful daughters and a son. Together, they have given me and my wife three grand-daughters and two grandsons.  I made those social media posts openly and I invite the public to judge for themselves whether they objectify or denigrate women in any way.  I am also hugely disappointed in the mainstream media and irresponsible alternative media for attempting to make a mountain out of a molehill. This is gutter politics at its worst. Calls were made for a clean and fair contest but it appears that the establishment are keen to win at all cost.  I have faith that my fellow Singaporeans will not allow our electoral system to be debased by scurrilous attacks. Tan Kin Lian</content>

    <content>I bought this artwork for my father on his birthday many years ago, perhaps more than 20 years ago. It could be for his 75th or 80th birthday. The Chinese character means "long life". My father had since passed away 17 years ago at the age of 82. I inherited this artwork which is now in my bedroom.  I am now 75 years old, so this is now suitable for me.  I do not know if artwork is the right term to describe this item. </content>

    <content>I was the target of a smear campaign over the past few days.¬† Someone sent a few screen shots of my Facebook posts over the past 10 years to the mainstream media. These posts were about "pretty girls" that I met at the shops, on the jogging path or at a mall. The sender was said that she felt uneasy about these posts.¬† I thought initially that it was the view of a single person and that the mainstream media should not blow it up.¬†I was wrong.¬† It is now clear to me that it is a concerted effort by an attack group that went all out to smear me. The editors of the mainstream media appears to be part of this smear effort.¬† The concerted effort later involved a woman right's organization and a comment by the presidential election committee. The mainstream media wrote up the episode to make me look very bad. A fair and impartial mainstream media would have realized that my posts would have been seen by several hundreds of thousand people over the years and that most people who consider them to be light hearted and non-offensive. It is dishonest for the media to portray them negatively. Many of my supporters were concerned about the negative impact on my campaign. Some of them pledged to work doubly hard to overcome this handicap. Many others said that this is clearly a malicious and unjustified smear effort. Let me say a few words about "building trust" and "uniting the people".¬† The government uses these words as their goals. But these are words, because their actual deeds appear to be different. Many people said that they do not trust the hollow words. The government leaders cannot build trust if they act in a dishonorable way. They cannot unite the people if they are seen to be attacking, in an underhand way, the reputation of the people whom they consider to be their opponents. I am not even their opponent.¬† In spite of this bad incident, I still pledge to work with the government, if I am elected as the president. I will continue my effort to influence the government to change their policies so that the people of Singapore can have a better life. My goals are to bring down inflation, make housing affordable and jobs secure.¬† Tan Kin Lian</content>
