    <content>As a hopeful president of Singapore, I remain resolute in my commitment to serve the people of this great nation. Despite any challenges or obstacles that may arise, I am steadfast in my determination to stand up for the needs and interests of all Singaporeans. Whether through community outreach, or other means, I will work tirelessly to ensure that the voices of the people are heard and their concerns addressed.

    <content>I totally reject AWARE‚Äôs allegations and insinuations that social media posts I have made ‚Äúobjectify‚Äù women.  I do not objectify women since I have many in my family. I have been happily married to my loving wife for nearly 50 years.  We have been faithful to each other through the years and no tinge of infidelity or scandal has ever attached to my marriage.  I have two wonderful daughters and a son. Together, they have given me and my wife three grand-daughters and two grandsons.  I made those social media posts openly and I invite the public to judge for themselves whether they objectify or denigrate women in any way.  I am also hugely disappointed in the mainstream media and irresponsible alternative media for attempting to make a mountain out of a molehill. This is gutter politics at its worst. Calls were made for a clean and fair contest but it appears that the establishment are keen to win at all cost.  I have faith that my fellow Singaporeans will not allow our electoral system to be debased by scurrilous attacks. Tan Kin Lian</content>
