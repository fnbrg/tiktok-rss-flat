    <content>Met my friend Catholic Archbishop Marco Tin Win from Mandalay, Myanmar. He shared with me his  dream of building a small meditation centre in the hills of Mandalay. Myanmar as a Buddhist country is steeped in the tradition of meditation but the Catholic Church had placed little emphasis on the interior life. Catholics have grown up in a Buddhist environment with a longing and capacity for silence and meditation.
