    <content>I had a hectic but rewarding day full of meaningful interactions today. Started bright and early for a visit to Ghim Moh Market, where I explained that I am funding my campaign from my own savings and not accepting any political donations because I do not want to be beholden to anyone in my bid for the presidency. I also shared my views on why the President may have difficulty acting in a truly objective manner if he or she has too close a relationship with the Prime Minister of the day. I also met many residents and market visitors, including some old colleagues from GIC! After a quick stop at home to freshen up and have a chat with Max (in Teochew!), I was off to the iconic ABC Brickworks Market to meet more Singaporeans. One of them invited me to join him in a rousing rendition of The Moon Represents My Heart (Yue Liang Dai Biao Wo De Xin) and I gladly obliged!  In the late afternoon, Sybil and I had a deeply meaningful time visiting Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital where we learned more about the important work they do to ease the suffering of the less fortunate and the elderly. This time, I was not there as the main guest but as Sybil's companion! The hospital had invited her to visit after learning of her philanthropy work, especially in the fields of healthcare and elder care. My Presidential Candidate Broadcast also aired on TV today, in which I shared with Singaporeans why it is high time we had a President who is truly non-partisan for a change ‚Äî that is, one with no ties to any political party. Finally, we rounded off the day with a delicious plate of satay bee hoon and more warm conversations with fellow Singaporeans and food lovers at Chomp Chomp Food Centre. I was very touched to see one resident brandishing a styrofoam sign that said Vote NKS! There's just one week left for campaigning. I'm ready to give it my all. See you on the ground! #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>

    <content>Too Kiasi already lah! Singapore is not operating at its full potential yet because we have a culture of being too cautious. I think we can be more creative and adventurous to take some risk. I hold the idea of fun very close to my heart. I want to encourage fun ways for our youths to educate themselves! This will ultimately help us be more competitive and prosperous.#ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>

    <content>am standing as a true non-partisan Presidential candidate and I have never had any affiliation with political parties. I will be able to discharge my duties without fear or favour. I will be able to serve all Singaporeans in their best interests while working with the government. The people of Singapore needs someone who is familiar with the machinery of the government yet is non-partisan. I am that person. #unitedforourfuture #ngkoksong2023  üñêüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>

    <content>I was given the opportunity to share with the leaders of Taman Bacaan my gratitude to the Malay and Muslim communities for the backing of Salleh, Ameer, Hamid as my assenters. Taman Bacaan and I had also talked about the idea of building more interracial help so that we can all be more invested in each other's communities and that is crucial for our long-term stability. They also talked about the deep kindness they want to see in Singapore. I felt the force of it. Thank you, Taman Bacaan! #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è Vote for Me </content>

    <content>After an exciting interview today, I came back to rest before bringing Max for his daily walk. He looks forward to these walks and it is our special family time together. I‚Äôll be headed out again soon to Kent Ridge Guild House for ‚ÄòMeet The Presidential Candidate Series‚Äô hosted by Prof Walid! Many of you have asked me if this will be live-streamed. It won‚Äôt be but I will be sharing some of the insights on social media this week. I am excited to meet more amazing Singaporeans soon! #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #catsoftiktok #cats #britishshorthaircat  üñêüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è Vote for Me </content>

    <content>I know Sybil to be a successful, accomplished and mature woman. She has seen life and has been through enough experiences to develop her own values. She adds so much more dimension and perspective into how I view things. I was single for 14 years after my wife Patricia passed of cancer. When I met Sybil, I was amazed by her beauty, brains and character. She celebrates strong women in all that she does, and I could not be prouder to call her my partner. ‚ù§Ô∏è #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>

    <content>I am focusing my campaign efforts on social media because I believe it is the most effective way to reach all of you. I find it important to make sure my messaging is aligned with our youths and current society. Through this process I‚Äôve also picked up some TikTok tricks from my young social media team üòÇ. I hear some concerns of missing out on reaching the older audience.  Fret not, I am doing as much walkabouts as I can, to meet them face to face. It is important to be sustainable. I want to be a President that is able to connect to the future of our country ‚Äî our youths. I believe my strategy has allowed me to hear their fears, hopes and dreams the best way possible. And I am thankful. ‚ù§Ô∏è #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>

    <content>No walkabouts today but I was certainly kept busy. Visited SPH Media this morning for a filming session at The Straits Times newsroom with fellow candidate Tharman, but I won't spoil what it was about. Keep a lookout for the video soon!  I also invited Jean from ST into my car for a quick interview on the way to the next campaign stop. We had a nice chat about how I'm keeping my energy levels up during this very busy season and how my loved ones are supporting me both on the ground and behind the scenes. In the afternoon, I took my cat Max for a short walk around the block before meeting reporters from Mothership for another interview. We took a look back at key moments in my campaign so far and I reflected on the highs and lows. Always good to take stock at halftime and strategise for the endgame. In the evening, I reunited with Prof Walid, this time in person, for a dialogue at the NUSS Kent Ridge Guild House with NUSS members. Let me tell you, the audience did not pull their punches! My social media team livestreamed part of the Q&amp;A session on Instagram and will upload a video of the full session as well as some clips soon. I shared with the audience why I felt compelled to run for the presidency, and what I plan to do with my salary if I am elected as President. Finally, I made a quick stop at Newton Food Centre for some fried Hokkien mee for supper. Some young Singaporeans who also were also feeling peckish recognised me from my social media videos and we took some selfies together. I will resume my public walkabouts tomorrow with visits to Chong Pang, Gardens by the Bay and Ang Mo Kio. Hope to catch some of you in person! #unitedforourfuture #ngkoksong2023  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>

    <content>Making it a daily ritual to practise my Teochew with Max. Soon he will be my conversation partner for brushing up on my Mandarin too. When I was young, I did not have the opportunity to learn Mandarin as my mother tongue was Teochew and I attended an English school. I regret not picking it up as an adult. But I am a firm believer in lifelong learning, so I will be taking Mandarin lessons after this election - and Max will learn too, since I'll be teaching¬†him¬†as¬†I¬†go! #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me </content>
