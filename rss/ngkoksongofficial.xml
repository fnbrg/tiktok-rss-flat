    <content>True happiness comes from caring for others. When I was at GIC, I derived happiness from contributing to the welfare of Singaporeans. So whatever you do, consider asking yourself ‚Äòhow can I contribute to the happiness and welfare of another person?‚Äô  Acts of kindness and generosity expand your being. But when you are self centred, you contract into your ego. You have to understand this through your experiences in life ‚ù§Ô∏è  #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #lifehacks #adulting #happiness </content>

    <content>Philanthropy is not just the giving of money. Companies in Singapore could do more to promote this idea of structured volunteerism. It means establishing a way for employees to contribute to community work.  Encourage staff to go down to the ground and do simple things such as distributing food to the poor. It doesn‚Äôt cost a lot of money but it costs time. So the leadership of these organisations must set an example. üôå #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #adulting #happiness #love </content>

    <content>Stepping into the markets after receiving my Certificate of Eligibility felt like a dream. When I was a kid, I spent most of time helping my dad at the fish market. Now I‚Äôm running to be your elected President. My dream has always been to be able to serve others. After working in the GIC for 45 years, serving the welfare of Singaporeans, I am honoured to be able to serve again. I will honour the hopes and dreams of our past, present and future generations. Thank you Singapore! #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #dreamscometrue #lifegoals #goals </content>

    <content>I loved at my job at the GIC too much because it was a job that brought out the best in me. I found meaning in it because I was not working for the shareholders of Goldman Sachs. I was working to build up the reserves for the people of Singapore. Now I want to help safeguard these reserves as President.  When you have a job that brings out the best in you and benefits others, that is good work. Consider asking yourself, what is it that brings out the best in you?  #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture </content>

The first was a testimonial from my school teacher when I graduated from Montfort School. The second was a letter from PM Lee Hsien Loong when I retired from GIC. These two documents are the bookends of my career. #unitedforourfuture #ngkoksong2023 </content>

    <content>My story is one of hope. I had to give up a scholarship to study overseas, because we were poor and I had to look after my family. My dreams came true when I got myself a bursary. It was my only way out of poverty and I had to work for the government. That was how I ended up at MAS and then GIC. I took so much pride in my work because it made me happy. I was able to contribute to growing the reserves for Singapore too. I want to inspire all of you to never give up on your hopes and dreams. I will safeguard your hopes and dreams as your president. Thank you Singapore for everything. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #family #love #dreamscometrue </content>
