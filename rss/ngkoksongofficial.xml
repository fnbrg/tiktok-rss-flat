    <content>I was given the opportunity to share with the leaders of Taman Bacaan my gratitude to the Malay and Muslim communities for the backing of Salleh, Ameer, Hamid as my assenters. Taman Bacaan and I had also talked about the idea of building more interracial help so that we can all be more invested in each other's communities and that is crucial for our long-term stability. They also talked about the deep kindness they want to see in Singapore. I felt the force of it. Thank you, Taman Bacaan! #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è Vote for Me </content>

    <content>After an exciting interview today, I came back to rest before bringing Max for his daily walk. He looks forward to these walks and it is our special family time together. I‚Äôll be headed out again soon to Kent Ridge Guild House for ‚ÄòMeet The Presidential Candidate Series‚Äô hosted by Prof Walid! Many of you have asked me if this will be live-streamed. It won‚Äôt be but I will be sharing some of the insights on social media this week. I am excited to meet more amazing Singaporeans soon! #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #catsoftiktok #cats #britishshorthaircat  üñêüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è Vote for Me </content>

    <content>I know Sybil to be a successful, accomplished and mature woman. She has seen life and has been through enough experiences to develop her own values. She adds so much more dimension and perspective into how I view things. I was single for 14 years after my wife Patricia passed of cancer. When I met Sybil, I was amazed by her beauty, brains and character. She celebrates strong women in all that she does, and I could not be prouder to call her my partner. ‚ù§Ô∏è #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>

    <content>I am focusing my campaign efforts on social media because I believe it is the most effective way to reach all of you. I find it important to make sure my messaging is aligned with our youths and current society. Through this process I‚Äôve also picked up some TikTok tricks from my young social media team üòÇ. I hear some concerns of missing out on reaching the older audience.  Fret not, I am doing as much walkabouts as I can, to meet them face to face. It is important to be sustainable. I want to be a President that is able to connect to the future of our country ‚Äî our youths. I believe my strategy has allowed me to hear their fears, hopes and dreams the best way possible. And I am thankful. ‚ù§Ô∏è #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>

    <content>No walkabouts today but I was certainly kept busy. Visited SPH Media this morning for a filming session at The Straits Times newsroom with fellow candidate Tharman, but I won't spoil what it was about. Keep a lookout for the video soon!  I also invited Jean from ST into my car for a quick interview on the way to the next campaign stop. We had a nice chat about how I'm keeping my energy levels up during this very busy season and how my loved ones are supporting me both on the ground and behind the scenes. In the afternoon, I took my cat Max for a short walk around the block before meeting reporters from Mothership for another interview. We took a look back at key moments in my campaign so far and I reflected on the highs and lows. Always good to take stock at halftime and strategise for the endgame. In the evening, I reunited with Prof Walid, this time in person, for a dialogue at the NUSS Kent Ridge Guild House with NUSS members. Let me tell you, the audience did not pull their punches! My social media team livestreamed part of the Q&amp;A session on Instagram and will upload a video of the full session as well as some clips soon. I shared with the audience why I felt compelled to run for the presidency, and what I plan to do with my salary if I am elected as President. Finally, I made a quick stop at Newton Food Centre for some fried Hokkien mee for supper. Some young Singaporeans who also were also feeling peckish recognised me from my social media videos and we took some selfies together. I will resume my public walkabouts tomorrow with visits to Chong Pang, Gardens by the Bay and Ang Mo Kio. Hope to catch some of you in person! #unitedforourfuture #ngkoksong2023  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>

    <content>Making it a daily ritual to practise my Teochew with Max. Soon he will be my conversation partner for brushing up on my Mandarin too. When I was young, I did not have the opportunity to learn Mandarin as my mother tongue was Teochew and I attended an English school. I regret not picking it up as an adult. But I am a firm believer in lifelong learning, so I will be taking Mandarin lessons after this election - and Max will learn too, since I'll be teaching¬†him¬†as¬†I¬†go! #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me </content>

    <content>This week, I visited the Singapore Malay Youth Library Association. Their mission is to ensure vulnerable Malay/Muslim youths are supported and integrated back into society. They employ kindness and attention to rehabilitate them. We must recognise such organisations that are doing good work to contribute to our social stability. This is something I want to improve when I am president. We need more interfaith awareness. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me </content>

    <content>My dear Singaporeans, I have chose to keep my campaign online in order to be sustainable and maximise my reach to our youths. Please share the following message to your family, friends and loved ones so they know me too üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è I ask for your vote for three reasons. First, I am an independent candidate. I do not belong to any political party. I will work with everyone, regardless of political affiliation, to serve the best interests of Singapore. Second, I spent 45 years in public service at MAS and GIC in building our reserves and I will protect it. I will also safeguard the integrity of key appointments in the public service. Third, I have extensive experience working with government leaders and corporate CEOs. I will do Singapore proud on the international stage.  Together, we can build a better and kinder Singapore. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è Vote for Me</content>

    <content>When we want to reach out to our youth, we need to be sincere about it. I decided to do my campaign mainly through social media because it was important for me to reach them via the right platform. To know what they‚Äôre watching and listening to, allowed me to understand firsthand their hopes and fears better. The big thing I learned is how much power technology holds in today‚Äôs age. It‚Äôs not just about posting selfies. Even the way we take one picture can have so many different meanings. Thank you to all of you for supporting my social media and joining me on my journey. I want to be a President that is sincere in connecting with our future leaders. This is not a charade for me. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>
