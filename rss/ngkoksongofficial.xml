    <content>My story is one of hope. I had to give up a scholarship to study overseas, because we were poor and I had to look after my family. My dreams came true when I got myself a bursary. It was my only way out of poverty and I had to work for the government. That was how I ended up at MAS and then GIC. I took so much pride in my work because it made me happy. I was able to contribute to growing the reserves for Singapore too. I want to inspire all of you to never give up on your hopes and dreams. I will safeguard your hopes and dreams as your president. Thank you Singapore for everything. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #family #love #dreamscometrue </content>

    <content>The role of the president should evolve with our experience. Our youth are increasingly involved in advocacy and the community. I think the president will be able to unite our country better if he or she evolves to fit the needs of the people too.  I want to teach our youths to be financially literate and help all of us alleviate our stress. Sybil is a huge advocate for the arts and people with special needs. We both will be able to uplift Singaporeans. It will be our honour to be given that chance. #unitedforourfuture #ngkoksong2023</content>

    <content>Love is the greatest gift I have received from life. My mother‚Äôs love inspired me to study hard and win a bursary so I would never see her cry again. My late wife Patricia taught me about unconditional love in our 33 years of marriage. When she passed, I became a single dad. I learned more about love as I played the roles of mother and father to my youngest daughter. After 14 years of being single, Sybil walked into my life to bless me with newfound love. Thanks to her, I am still learning so much and I am thankful to have her as my equal partner in this journey. I want to give back to Singapore for all the love it has given me. It would be the greatest honour of my life. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #family #lovewins #nostalgia </content>

    <content>Singapore is a little red dot. But we are internationally recognised because of our exceptionalism in political and social stability! We cannot take these for granted.  As President, I will use my experience to safeguard this stability. I want to honour our founding fathers and the Merdeka generation ‚Äî people who have built Singapore for all our future generations. We must not let what we built up be squandered. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #singapore #singaporetiktok #leekuanyew </content>

    <content>Last Saturday, I had the opportunity to have a discussion with these change-makers from the creative scene. They are all accomplished in their own fields and shared their thoughts on the future of our arts scene.  I am determined to encourage our youths to step into their passions without any fear of security or stability. I was so happy to have had this intimate session with them. I want to do more of these! #unitedforourfuture #ngkoksong2023</content>
