    <content>I shared my secret to staying healthy at 75, ‘SHIELD’. This acronym was coined by Dr Rudolph Tanzi who specialises in Alzheimer’s and neurology. It is heartening that so many of you guys have picked up on my version of it and helped spread this life-saving message. When I came to know that Dr. Rudolph Tanzi is on the Scientific Board for Chromadex, it stimulated my interest in his work. He has been a leader in Alzheimer’s research for decades . I started reading up on some of his books , “The Super Brain” and “The Healing Self”, where I came across the wonderful acronym Dr. Tanzi used for healthy lifestyle especially when one is aging - S.H.I.E.L.D. When I had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Tanzi via zoom, I wanted to know how he came up with his acronym. Here is a sneak peek of the conversation. I hope that we continue to spread positive messages like this, so that we can keep the online space a truly beneficial one for all ❤️</content>

    <content>Meditation entered my life at a critical juncture thirty five years ago when I was searching for deeper meaning, purpose and happiness. It took me three years to establish  the daily practice of meditating every morning and evening.  Meditation has transformed  my life in my work, relationships and leadership responsibilities by the  cultivation of attention and other- centredness.  From my experience, meditation has been the kindest thing I have done for myself. It is also probably the kindest thing we can do for others because  meditation helps us grow in love, peace and joy. This is why I would like to share with you my practice of meditation so that your life too can be transformed. #meditation #mentalhealth #lifehacks #lifeskills #mentalhealthmatters </content>
