    <content>Spent Sunday with my old friends and some new ones I made over the past 2 months. We had lunch together savouring traditional Malay food with a modern spin by the passionate chef. The mee siam was a hit amongst us Montfort boys — it took us back to our favourite mee siam stall in school!  Thankful for the time and attention all of these amazing folks gave me during the past few weeks.</content>

    <content>Meditation helped me and my late wife when she was dying of cancer to stay calm and peaceful in the face of extreme stress. While undergoing treatment, she remained cheerful in her final days. Our 15 year practice of meditation prepared us to be at peace in the face of difficulty and extreme adversity. After her passing, meditation helped me cope with my sadness. #mentalhealth #peace #lifelessons #cancer #cancerawareness </content>
