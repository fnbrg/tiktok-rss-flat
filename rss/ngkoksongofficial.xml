    <content>Meditation helped me and my late wife when she was dying of cancer to stay calm and peaceful in the face of extreme stress. While undergoing treatment, she remained cheerful in her final days. Our 15 year practice of meditation prepared us to be at peace in the face of difficulty and extreme adversity. After her passing, meditation helped me cope with my sadness. #mentalhealth #peace #lifelessons #cancer #cancerawareness </content>
