    <content>Love is the greatest gift I have received from life. My mother‚Äôs love inspired me to study hard and win a bursary so I would never see her cry again. My late wife Patricia taught me about unconditional love in our 33 years of marriage. When she passed, I became a single dad. I learned more about love as I played the roles of mother and father to my youngest daughter. After 14 years of being single, Sybil walked into my life to bless me with newfound love. Thanks to her, I am still learning so much and I am thankful to have her as my equal partner in this journey. I want to give back to Singapore for all the love it has given me. It would be the greatest honour of my life. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #family #lovewins #nostalgia </content>

    <content>Singapore is a little red dot. But we are internationally recognised because of our exceptionalism in political and social stability! We cannot take these for granted.  As President, I will use my experience to safeguard this stability. I want to honour our founding fathers and the Merdeka generation ‚Äî people who have built Singapore for all our future generations. We must not let what we built up be squandered. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture #singapore #singaporetiktok #leekuanyew </content>

    <content>Last Saturday, I had the opportunity to have a discussion with these change-makers from the creative scene. They are all accomplished in their own fields and shared their thoughts on the future of our arts scene.  I am determined to encourage our youths to step into their passions without any fear of security or stability. I was so happy to have had this intimate session with them. I want to do more of these! #unitedforourfuture #ngkoksong2023</content>

    <content>I am an independent candidate. I stepped up for the presidency because I want to give Singaporeans a choice. I have never been a part of any political party or the governing party. We need to consider that the ‚Äòestablishment‚Äô covers a very wide spectrum. Religious and civic organisations are also part of the establishment. I have the competence and experience to be a stabilising check to the government. I want to work with the government for the people. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture</content>

From my years of experience at MAS and GIC, I know how the global financial system works. Being in the public sector for almost all my life, I am also aware of who has the right character to be given key appointments.

    <content>When I was still in the public service, There was also little risk of a bad government. I was happy in my dream job. Serving the people of Singapore, by growing our reserves strategically was meaningful work. At that stage of my life, that was the best way I could contribute to Singapore. Now I want to safeguard the reserves I have helped to grow.  #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture </content>
