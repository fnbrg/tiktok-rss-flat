    <content>All of us have got certain gifts and skills. Good work is the kind of work that brings out the best in you, regardless of your background. I am thankful I did not heed advice to leave the GIC. My job gave me satisfaction because I was able to exploit my talent to benefit a greater good ‚Äî the nation‚Äôs financial security. Now, I am ready to use my years of experience to joyfully serve the people of Singapore, as your elected President. I humbly ask for you to give me this chance, as the only non-partisan candidate. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me </content>

    <title>Leonard Cohen‚Äôs Anthem is one of my favourite songs. It reminds us that it is perfectly okay to be imperfect.  We must keep doing things that matter to us and trying our best. With experience and reflection, we improve. This is a very powerful life lesson</title>

    <content>Leonard Cohen‚Äôs Anthem is one of my favourite songs. It reminds us that it is perfectly okay to be imperfect.  We must keep doing things that matter to us and trying our best. With experience and reflection, we improve. This is a very powerful life lesson I hope to encourage everyone to hold on to. Through this campaign, I am learning so much from our youths and the power of social media. I am made aware of our diverse hopes, dreams and causes we all champion. I will continue to deepen my understanding so we develop a Singapore for all. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  Vote For Me  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è</content>

    <content>Here‚Äôs a very personal interview I did a while back with @Mothership . I shared with them the 3 most important things in my life. I am thankful for my experiences in life. I took responsibility to lift my family out of poverty by winning myself a bursary. When I was the GIC, I took responsibility for growing our reserves and navigating financial crises. When my wife was dying of cancer, I took responsibility to spend every day with her to make sure she knew she was loved. Now, I am ready to be responsible for the people of Singapore as your President. I want us to be United for our future. üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è#ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture </content>

    <content>The value of our reserves is strategically important and must be kept a secret. It is dangerous to suggest that the Government should reveal this information publicly, which would only benefit our enemies. This goes against our national interest and leave the Singapore Dollar vulnerable to attack or manipulation.  If elected President, I will want to know how much we have in the reserves, what proportion is set aside for future generations and how much is to be used to benefit the current generation. But I will keep our secrets safe. With my years of experience in the GIC building up our reserves, I will ask the right questions and work with the Government to ensure they are used prudently. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  Vote For Me  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è</content>

    <content>I want to be the chief volunteer to rally more people to share their time and energy to serve the community. The next step is for Singaporeans to practise more inter-faith and inter-racial mutual help. We must go beyond just helping our own communities. This will help us deepen our understanding of who we are as Singaporeans and find commonality in our Singaporean-ness. I have been practising philanthropy for a long time. I want to leverage on the connections I have to encourage people to come forward and foster volunteerism within institutions. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  Vote For Me  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è</content>

    <content>This morning, I paid a visit to several coffee shops in Marine Parade and the nearby GoodLife! Makan community kitchen run by Montfort Care for seniors who live alone. It was good to see seniors of all walks of life and from different communities coming together for meals and companionship. This is an excellent example of how we can go beyond self-help to inter-racial, inter-faith mutual help. If I am elected, I will use my platform to foster more of such initiatives. In the afternoon, I returned to Mediacorp to record my second Presidential Candidate Broadcast which will air tomorrow. It will be one of the final messages that will go out before Cooling-Off Day so I wanted to get it right. Then in the evening, I had planned to visit Clementi 448 Market &amp; Food Centre, but unfortunately did not get a chance to. I spent almost an hour meeting and taking photos with residents who had formed an orderly queue near the mall. It was a warm and happy occasion, marred only by a heckler who approached my team and me with hostility. I won't speculate on the young man's motives. He must have had his frustrations, which he chose to take out on me for reasons only known to himself. I bear him no ill will. I had earlier spoken to the media about my worries regarding a growing cynicism and distrust towards the government among the youth of today. If elected, I will do all I can to inspire more hope among Singaporeans, including those who do not support me.  We all face difficulties in life. Let's all be more understanding towards one another. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  Vote For Me  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è</content>

    <content>My campaign efforts were focused online and on the ground. Through my social media efforts, I was able to interact with and understand our youths, including their fears and hopes. Similarly, walking the ground has been very heartening. Nothing beats hearing the concerns and stories of Singaporeans first hand. They have helped me level the playing field with other candidates. I have been very candid and direct with you because I want you to know that I will keep to my word. Thank you for trusting me and giving me your time and attention. If elected President, I will carry out my duties honourably.üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture </content>
