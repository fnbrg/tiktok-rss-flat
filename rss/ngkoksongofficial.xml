    <content>My campaign efforts were focused online and on the ground. Through my social media efforts, I was able to interact with and understand our youths, including their fears and hopes. Similarly, walking the ground has been very heartening. Nothing beats hearing the concerns and stories of Singaporeans first hand. They have helped me level the playing field with other candidates. I have been very candid and direct with you because I want you to know that I will keep to my word. Thank you for trusting me and giving me your time and attention. If elected President, I will carry out my duties honourably.üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture </content>

    <content>On the final day of the campaign, I paid a visit to Hougang Hainanese Village in the morning. I grew up in Hougang and it always brings back fond memories. I was glad to be able to make a stop at this nostalgic place. I was blessed to be able to visit Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery, hosted by Reverend Ming Yi. We discussed the benefits of meditation and the importance of inter faith and inter-racial collaboration. I presented a book entitled Common Ground to the Reverend, which commemorates a two-day event I organised in 2012 to bring together leaders from different faiths to find common ground in the practice of meditation. I also had the privilege of meditating together with the devotees in silence. I then made a stop at the Church of the Holy Family to say a short prayer. My church holds a special place in my heart. It is where I worship with my family. It is where I said goodbye to my late wife Patricia and delivered her eulogy. My final stop of the campaign is at Kopitam Square in Sengkang. One last chance to meet my fellow Singaporeans before Cooling-Off Day. I have given my very best for this contest. Thank you to each and every voter who plans to support me on Friday. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Vote for Me</content>
