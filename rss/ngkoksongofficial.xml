    <content>Met my friend Catholic Archbishop Marco Tin Win from Mandalay, Myanmar. He shared with me his  dream of building a small meditation centre in the hills of Mandalay. Myanmar as a Buddhist country is steeped in the tradition of meditation but the Catholic Church had placed little emphasis on the interior life. Catholics have grown up in a Buddhist environment with a longing and capacity for silence and meditation. At the national level, the oeople have been going through a tough time with the unstable political situation and the Covid pandemic. Hence the urgent need for a place of silence to heal the trauma of war and conflict.  I agreed to lend my support for Bishop Marco‚Äôs worthwhile endeavour.</content>
