    <content>10.26am, 18 August 2023, marks the start of my official journey as a Presidential Candidate to continue to serve all Singaporeans. The Presidential Elections Committee has issued me the Certificate of Eligibility. As I reflect, I would like to honour the generations before me who built the strong foundation of Singapore. For all of us, here and now, let's do our best for the current and future generations to realise our hopes and ensure that Singapore continues to thrive. I will give my very best to this Presidential bid, as I seek the privilege to be of service and build a united Singapore for the future. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture </content>
