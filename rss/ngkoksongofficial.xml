    <title>I have learned we must search for peace within ourselves, all the great religions teach us this. Meditation helped me look past the illusion of power and control. Going within ourselves, helps us see our oneness. #mentalhealth #peace #lifelessons #meditat</title>

    <content>Meditation helped me and my late wife when she was dying of cancer to stay calm and peaceful in the face of extreme stress. While undergoing treatment, she remained cheerful in her final days. Our 15 year practice of meditation prepared us to be at peace in the face of difficulty and extreme adversity. After her passing, meditation helped me cope with my sadness. #mentalhealth #peace #lifelessons #cancer #cancerawareness </content>

    <content>I shared my secret to staying healthy at 75, ‘SHIELD’. This acronym was coined by Dr Rudolph Tanzi who specialises in Alzheimer’s and neurology. It is heartening that so many of you guys have picked up on my version of it and helped spread this life-saving message. When I came to know that Dr. Rudolph Tanzi is on the Scientific Board for Chromadex, it stimulated my interest in his work. He has been a leader in Alzheimer’s research for decades . I started reading up on some of his books , “The Super Brain” and “The Healing Self”, where I came across the wonderful acronym Dr. Tanzi used for healthy lifestyle especially when one is aging - S.H.I.E.L.D. When I had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Tanzi via zoom, I wanted to know how he came up with his acronym. Here is a sneak peek of the conversation. I hope that we continue to spread positive messages like this, so that we can keep the online space a truly beneficial one for all ❤️</content>
