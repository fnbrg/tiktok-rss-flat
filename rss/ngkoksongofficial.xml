    <content>The first place I went to after my nomination, was Kangkar (Hougang). When my son pointed out the exact spot we used to live in, I was overwhelmed with gratitude and emotions. I had to give up my scholarship to study overseas as my father lost his voice and could not work. I studied with a local bursary and secured a job in the government to support my family and lift them out of poverty.  I want every Singaporean to know that they can make it in life too. I was just a poor boy from Kangkar. Now, I‚Äôm running to be your President. I want to inspire others who don‚Äôt have a fair start in life, to never give up on their hopes and dreams. #unitedforourfuture #ngkoksong2023 </content>

It is more affordable and it has that hint of bitterness. Just the right mix! Our identity as the country that loves Durian is just one of many things that keep us United. It makes us smile.

    <content>When Pope John Paul II visited Singapore in 1986, the first thing he did after getting off the plane was to kneel down and kiss the tarmac as a sign of respect. I did the same when I visited the site of my childhood home in Kangkar on Tuesday, after being officially confirmed as a Presidential candidate. It was my way of showing respect to the place I came from and honouring those who came before me, who shaped me into the person I am. I would not be standing as a Presidential candidate today if not for simple love of my parents, who worked hard to support my dreams. #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>

    <content>I had a hectic but rewarding day full of meaningful interactions today. Started bright and early for a visit to Ghim Moh Market, where I explained that I am funding my campaign from my own savings and not accepting any political donations because I do not want to be beholden to anyone in my bid for the presidency. I also shared my views on why the President may have difficulty acting in a truly objective manner if he or she has too close a relationship with the Prime Minister of the day. I also met many residents and market visitors, including some old colleagues from GIC! After a quick stop at home to freshen up and have a chat with Max (in Teochew!), I was off to the iconic ABC Brickworks Market to meet more Singaporeans. One of them invited me to join him in a rousing rendition of The Moon Represents My Heart (Yue Liang Dai Biao Wo De Xin) and I gladly obliged!  In the late afternoon, Sybil and I had a deeply meaningful time visiting Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital where we learned more about the important work they do to ease the suffering of the less fortunate and the elderly. This time, I was not there as the main guest but as Sybil's companion! The hospital had invited her to visit after learning of her philanthropy work, especially in the fields of healthcare and elder care. My Presidential Candidate Broadcast also aired on TV today, in which I shared with Singaporeans why it is high time we had a President who is truly non-partisan for a change ‚Äî that is, one with no ties to any political party. Finally, we rounded off the day with a delicious plate of satay bee hoon and more warm conversations with fellow Singaporeans and food lovers at Chomp Chomp Food Centre. I was very touched to see one resident brandishing a styrofoam sign that said Vote NKS! There's just one week left for campaigning. I'm ready to give it my all. See you on the ground! #ngkoksong2023 #unitedforourfuture  üñêüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Vote For Me</content>
