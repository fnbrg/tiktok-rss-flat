    <content>Spent Sunday with my old friends and some new ones I made over the past 2 months. We had lunch together savouring traditional Malay food with a modern spin by the passionate chef. The mee siam was a hit amongst us Montfort boys — it took us back to our favourite mee siam stall in school!  Thankful for the time and attention all of these amazing folks gave me during the past few weeks.</content>
